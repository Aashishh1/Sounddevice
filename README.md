Welcome to the **Python Audio Recording**. This guide will help you understand how to record audio and save it as a WAV file using the `sounddevice` and `scipy` libraries.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `sounddevice`
- `scipy`

## 🎯 Features
- **Customizable Duration**: Change the `duration` variable to record for a different length of time.
- **High-Quality Audio**: Records at a sample rate of 44.1 kHz (CD quality).

## 💡 Tips
- Ensure your microphone is set as the default recording device on your system.
- Adjust the `channels` parameter if you need mono (1) or stereo (2) recording.
